# Split Or Steal Bot

<h2>Status:</h2>

Project closed. I'm not planning to make any updates (unless I change my mind). If you want to make it undetected, then there's a lot of work to do.

Fast bot for "Split or Steal" game. The game doesn't need to be on foreground window.
Tested and created on <b>1.5.1.</b> version of the game.
Currently always splitting.
