# Split Or Steal Bot

Fast bot for "Split or Steal" game. The game doesn't need to be on foreground window.
Tested and created on <b>1.5.1.</b> version of the game.
Currently always splitting.

<b>Features:</b>
- early auto split (before 10 seconds preparation time)
- early auto lock in (before 10 seconds preparation time)
- auto return to Main Menu
- auto match accept
- auto join queue
- skin changer
- auto message
- auto cash out at tier 10
- auto rejoin queue if someone did not accept

<b>Installation:</b>

Copy "Assembly-CSharp.dll" to ".\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Split or Steal\Split Or Steal_Data\Managed\".

You can always come back to "normal" version of the game by verifying game files on Steam or replacing this .dll file you just replaced.

<b>Bans:</b>

There's a high chance to get banned with this bot (spamming same message and skipping preparation time) - disabling those features would decrease ban chance. I think getting reported is the only way of getting banned - I don't think this game's "Anti-Bot" is worth much.
